# Home_value_prediction

**1. Project Objective:**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating the total value of properties based on various features like lot size, property type, year of construction, and more. The goal is to provide a reliable tool for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate agents to assess property values quickly and efficiently.

**2. Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project consists of several attributes related to properties, including lot size, age, property type, among others. Each entry represents a different property with its associated total value. This data has been split into training and testing sets to validate the performance of the model.

**3. Approach:**

The approach taken includes several steps:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and transforming categorical data into a usable format.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features that influence property values.
- **Data Normalization**: Scaling the features to normalize the distribution.
- **Model Building**: Using multiple linear regression to predict the total value of the properties.
- **Validation**: Evaluating the model's performance with testing data.

**4. Results:**

The model was trained using multiple linear regression and achieved satisfactory results. The residuals between the predicted and actual values are approximately normally distributed around zero, indicating that the model's errors are random and not biased. This suggests the model is suitable for estimating property values with reasonable accuracy. Histograms and performance metrics support the model's effectiveness.
